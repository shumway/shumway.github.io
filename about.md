I have a passion for helping people through computation. Great computer products
should be fun, empowering, and inspirational. In my current work, I coordinate
the work of a team of gifted developers to produce ECHELON, a state-of-the-art
engineering tool. By leveraging scalable algorithms, GPU computation, and agile
software development, we have created a commercial application that is
transforming reservoir engineering. Using C++, CUDA, and Javascript, ECHELON
delivers unprecedented speed and computational density, enabling new engineering
workflows. In my work I use my technical skills in C++14, CUDA, Python 3,
Javascript, and software design alongside the soft skills of team building,
organization, product delivery, and building a culture of software
craftsmanship, quality, and testing.

I have been married to my wife Lynn for more than 20 years. We have five kids,
including my daughter Julia, a journalist who inspires me in her work with
politics and people. In my free time I enjoy computer programming, gardening,
hiking with my family, and playing guitar. I also enjoy teaching and mentoring
young people, and I immersed myself in science and education for over a decade
as a professor of theoretical physics.
